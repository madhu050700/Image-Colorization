# Image-Colorization

Given a grayscale image, we propose a fully automatic approach that produces vibrant and realistic
colorization.

We can utilize any colored image to extract the grayscale channels. For our task, we split the dataset
into training, validation, and testing in which we use 1.3M images from the ImageNet training set
to train our network, the first 10k images in the ImageNet validation set to validate and test on a
separate 10k images in the validation set.
